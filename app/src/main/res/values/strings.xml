        All our meals are cooked and packed in our own specially designed scientific kitchen spread over 500 sq ft.\n
        We measure portions: All the ingredients are carefully weighed and cooked as per Tiffinshiffin’s crafted recipes.\n
We have different sections: Non-vegetarian food is cooked in a separate section and the supplies are stocked separately to ensure that vegetarian and non-vegetarian food is not mixed.
\nWe take preventive measures: Salads and Fruit bowls are prepared in an air conditioned environment and the food is not touched by hand while packaging.
\nWe welcome everyone: All our customers are welcome to visit the kitchen at any time, with or without prior notice.
